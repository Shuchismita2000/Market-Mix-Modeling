# Case Study-Market-Mix-Modeling

You are working with a global consumer goods company in Hair Care category that wants to optimize its marketing spend across various channels and maximize sales. The company has provided a time series dataset covering weekly sales, marketing activity, and other relevant factors (such as seasonality, promotions, and economic indicators) over the last 122 weeks. The company is interested in understanding the following:
1. How each marketing channel has contributed to sales historically.
2. Is there any impact of seasonality and any external economic factors on sales.
3. Impact of Promotion and other marketing levers.

## Dataset:

## Tasks:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Describe your approach to exploring this dataset before modeling. What trends, patterns, or anomalies would you look for, and why? Use this dataset and highlight top 10 findings from the data and sales drivers.

### 2. Modeling Approach:
Outline the steps you would take to build an MMM model for this dataset. Which variables or transformations would you consider, and how would you handle external economic factors and seasonality in the model? If any derived seasonality variable has been used in the model, please share its calculations.

### 3. Write a code in Python for the modeling approach you prefer and run the model with model results highlighting statistical parameters.

### 4. Interpreting Results:
How would you interpret the result? What recommendations would you provide to the company? Do you observe any strong seasonal pattern in the data? If yes, then how would you adjust your recommendations to account for this?

### 5. Optimization:
